The Card Links Power-Up ("the Power-Up") is designed to enhance your Trello experience by allowing you to create and manage links between cards on the same board. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the data we handle.

## Information We Collect

### Data Stored by the Power-Up

The Power-Up stores only the following information:

1. **Card Link Relationships**
   - **What:** Links between cards on the same board
   - **Format:** Card IDs paired with linked card IDs (e.g., `{ cardId: [linkedCardId1, linkedCardId2, ...] }`)
   - **Where:** Stored using Trello's built-in Power-Up storage at the board level
   - **Access:** Shared with all members who have access to the board

2. **No Personal Information**
   - The Power-Up does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal information
   - No user names, email addresses, or personal identifiers are collected

- All data remains within Trello's ecosystem

## Data Sharing

### Within Trello

- Link data is stored at the **board level** and is accessible to all members with access to that board
- This is necessary for the Power-Up to function, as linked cards must be visible to relevant team members

### External Sharing

We do **not** share your data with any third parties:
- No data is sold, rented, or shared with advertisers
- No data is shared with analytics services
- No data is shared with any external services

All data is protected by Trello's security measures:
- Data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access is controlled through Trello's permission system
- Data is subject to Trello's security practices and compliance standards

### Our Commitment

- The Power-Up code is open-source and available for review
- No sensitive data processing occurs in the Power-Up

## Your Rights and Control

### Managing Your Data

You have full control over your data:

2. **Add Links:** Create links between any cards on the same board
3. **Remove Links:** Delete links at any time through the "Manage Links" interface
4. **Delete Cards:** Links to deleted cards are automatically cleaned up

### Disabling the Power-Up
